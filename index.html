<h2>www.bioxml.org</h2>

<b>bioxml.org</b> is a resource to gather XML documentation,
DTDs and tools for biology in one central location.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bio.perl.org/Projects/XML">An page about XML hosted on bio.perl.org</a>.
<p>

www.bioxml.org hopes to expand from this start and take on a much more
repository orientated role towards XML in biology. For example, keeping the
DTDs in a open repository and providing tools in many languages 
which work with the biological XML formats proposed here.
<p>
<li><a href="charter.html">What is bioxml.org and how is it run?</a>
</ul>

This page is a placeholder until the full web site is fleshed out.
