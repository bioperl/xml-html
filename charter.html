<h2>how bioxml is run</h2>

bioxml.org is hosts a web server and a cvs repository for XML
documentation and tools in biology. Anybody can get access to the cvs
repository to edit the documents/source code within and commit
information back into the repository as long as they agree with the
policy that all the documentation and the source code is released
under a <b>Apache-style license</b>. For more legal information on this
you can read this <a href=>page</a> but for the long and short of it, it
means that code and documentation come with very few restrictions 
on its use. bioxml was set up by volunteers in laboratories world wide
to help us with scientific problems, and we are an open, collaborative group 
of people.
<p>
People who get an account and then spend their time deliberately
trashing parts of the source code will be chucked out, but that hasn't
happened yet, and probably wont in the future.
<p>
A number of people actively develop parts of bioxml. There does need
to be some people who are officially coordinating projects, and these
people are the people who actually say when things are released. [if
you want to know the nitty gritty of it, these people are the people
who put the release labels into the cvs repository of those modules].
The coordinators are
<ul>
<li>Suzi Lewis - for the xml-dtd module
</ul>
Otherwise decisions are made by informal consensus on the xml developers
list at xml-dev@bioxml.org
<hr>
bioxml is colocated with bio.perl.org on a donated alpha server from
Compaq and with bandwidth donated by the genetics institute. There is
lots of cross-pollination between the bioxml guys and the bioperl guys
(some people are developers on both sites) but in no way is bioxml
perl-centric - it is XML centric.
